I am a Senior at the University of Mary Washington. I currently intern at MTEQ (Manufacturing Techniques Inc) and will be starting full time employment at TMA (Technology Management Associates) starting this summer as a software developer.

### More Information

Proficient in a wide array of computer languages including C++, C#, Java, Python, and many others. Attempt to be as flexible as possible and keep up to date by learning new things all the time. Hobbies include fitness, weightlifting, and motorcycles.

### My Philosophy

My philosphy for software development is to look at every challenge like a logical sequence of events that must take place in order for completion. In every project or piece of software that must be made, there are a set of steps that if followed, will lead to its completion. In this blog I hope to help you follow the set of steps that will allow you to use some of the concepts I have laid out before you.
