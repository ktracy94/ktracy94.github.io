I used multiple resources to learn these concepts and practices. They are listed below:

1. Ron Zacharski's YouTube Series - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuZfoSIficQvVN44F1emhKAF-1KIoRcok

2. http://www.w3schools.com/

3. Python-Flask's Main Website: http://flask.pocoo.org/

4. https://stackoverflow.com/

5. http://socket.io/

These were the 5 main resources I used, however there are really an unlimited amount on the Internet to learn these things. It is incredibly important to look these concepts up, rather than spend large amounts of time stuck on problems where other people can help you fix it in minutes. Some resources, including Stack Overflow, will allow you to present questions and have other people answer them. Others will be lists of concepts with them explained through tutorials similar to mine. By utilizing the Internet, you can work faster and get to your end result quicker.
