One thing that becomes clear after creating a basic website with Flask and Python is that there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to keep someone logged in throughout their time on your website. You could simply store their info in a dictionary, but as soon as they close the tab or their browser the data is cleared and they are logged out. When using any social media, you only have to log in once and you are logged in forever. This technique of persistant login functionality is called "Sessions".

Luckily sessions are pretty easy to implement, and they can be incredibly useful. Before starting, make sure you import sessions from the flask library. In my project where I used sessions, I first grabbed the username and password from the user through the same technique covered in the previous posts with the HTML forms.
