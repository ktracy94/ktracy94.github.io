In order to keep track of user information long term, it is absolutely necessary to store it in some form of database. Some of the most popular options include MongoDB, SQL, mySQL, postgresql, cassandra, and the list goes on and on. For my entire semester in CPSC 350, I've used postgresql as my database of choice. Postgresql is similar to regular SQL, however it is a completely open source solution. By being open source, it allows for implementation in a multitude of computer languages. One such language is its python implementation. The postgresql library for python is called "psycopg2", and once downloaded is easily included in the header of the file.

The first step to correctly using postgresql is getting the database running on your server. Once the correct libraries have been installed, simply 

	type sudo service postgresql start
    
into the terminal. This will start a database and also prompt you to create an account. Once your account is created, login to your client with the command

	psql -U postgres -h localhost
