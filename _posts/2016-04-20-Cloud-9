## Setting up a Cloud 9 Workspace

During this semester we used an online service called Cloud 9. Cloud 9 is an online development service that allows extremely easy development for websites and databases. Our particular assignments made Cloud 9 an ideal solution, as it allowed us to get websites running immediately. Another critical feature is the ability to create a "shared workspace", in which multiple people can develop simultaneously. This allows for group projects to be done extremely efficiently, with the entire group contributing at the same time.
